use matplotlib to do graphing questions

is x=2 a soln of
	null factor
	AF = number
	AF = AF
	crazy sqrt, cubic etc stuff
find x/y int of
	y=mx+c
	y-mx=c
	ay-amx=ac
find line parallel/perp to ay-amx=ac that passes through a point (choose line first then pick point using x=int)

* this probably isn't useful like I imagined, as long as you can increase/decrease difficulty whilst generating questions

Starting problem: simple equations with multiple x's, requiring collecting

Question 1:
2x = 3 - 3x
Ans: x=3/5
(use the numpad!)
* 0 - accept
* . - regenerate
* + - increase difficulty
* - - decrease difficulty
>-

Changed to: simple equations with one x

Question 1:
2x - 1 = 0
Ans: x=1/2
>.

Question 1:
x + 3 = 0
Ans: x=1/2
>0

Question 2:
3x = 3
Ans: x=1
>0

...

Finished section 1
x + 3 = 0
3x = 3
